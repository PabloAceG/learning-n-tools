## Scala

Java, but good. Multi-paradigm (concurrent, functional, imperative, OO), 
dynamically typed and scalable programming language. Designed to be concise. As 
functional programming language it includes tools like _currying_, 
_immutability_, _lazy evaluation_, and _pattern matching_. It also has an 
advanced type system, supporting: _algebraic data types_, _covariance and 
contravariance_, _higher-order types_ (not _higher-rank types_), and _anonymous 
types_.
