- [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/) - Free and guided 
  tutorials from MongoDB developers and professors.
- [Studio 3T Webpage](https://studio3t.com/) - It is a tool that allows writing queries
  in SQL and transforming them into MongoDB syntax. Don't worry, it's an 
  [official partner](https://www.mongodb.com/partners/studio-3t). Can be a good
  starting point to familiarize with MongoDB syntax.
## Tools
